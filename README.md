###### By Cole Straughn and Jonathan Lam

#### Description

#### Version
0.0.1: Created foundational global keyboard listener for future use. At this point, the program does not do anything but show pressed keys in the command prompt (so double-clicking the .jar file will not do anything).

#### Instructions
* Running the JAR
  * Double-click the "QuackBoard.jar" file.
  * In the command prompt, navigate to the appropriate directory and type "java -jar QuackBoard.jar".
* Compiling and running the Java file
  1. Modify the "Main.java" file as you wish.
  2. In the command prompt, compile the Java file and run the Class file (making sure you add "KeyboardHook.jar" to the classpath).
